With growing violence, poverty, climate change and need for reform in education and sciences; Voting becomes our only weapon in this fight. </p><br></br>
                            <p>Mark Your Presence was founded on the idea that we can create more change in our country if we work together. We are a non- profit and non -partisan organisation. Our aim is to create a positive change by reaching out to the youth and every citizen of the country on relevant issues that we are negligent about. </p><br></br>

                        <p>Mark Your Presence  has conducted seminars in colleges, which are affiliated with Mumbai University, Symbiosis University, and other private universities. Over the last year, we have registered over 25,000 new voters for the 2019 elections. We have registered voters in the 2019 Lok sabha MP elections, MLA elections in Mumbai and Delhi. Registration is only the first step of our campaign and the goal will be achieved only once we educate students at large about their right to vote and assist them. We have created a voter's manual which will help each individual understand the process of voting which includes the essential things a voter needs to do before he/she goes out to vote , and also educates the voter about his/her constituency and the role of the Member of Parliament, MLA, and Corporator. We not only register new voters but also follow up with the concerned BLO officers whenever there is a problem. On our website, the voters can track their voter ids, check if their name is on the Electoral roll, check their polling stations and also find out detailed information of their nearest election office. </p> */}
