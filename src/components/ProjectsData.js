        desc: "With this art movement we  connected voting to art and democracy so as to try to communicate our message to the public at large. The idea is to connect art and culture as a way to express our views. There are a lot of people who are not vocal about their rights but are extremely efficient at expressing their feelings through art. For this movement, forms of art are categorised as: Oil/Acrylic on canvas, sketching, graphically represented art and sculptures, and digital art forms. The best artwork will be  awarded by the CEO's  office."

This challenge was created  for those who adapt to writing as a form of expression to express their views. We  believe writing plays an instrumental role in expressing one's thoughts and could be used to spread awareness."
